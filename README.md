# advent-of-code-2021
Working through [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) as a way to learn python.

## TODO
- set up a test framework and github action to assert existing code works
- refactor to use list comprehension 


See last year's repo for better structured and tested Kotlin code: [AoC 2020](https://github.com/bpatzin2/advent-of-code-2020)
